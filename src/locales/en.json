      "description": "The meetups work like in other usual groups: a plan is proposed, approved, and organized. The difference is that here, priority will be given to those where it is not necessary to pay to participate. If something paid is organized, we will try to reduce these costs as much as possible. In the meetups group, these topics will be discussed and, once a meetup is approved, it will be published in the channel."
